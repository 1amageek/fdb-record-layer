# Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Proof of Concept

## üöß Implementation Status: PROTOTYPE

This implementation is a **proof of concept** demonstrating the architecture of FoundationDB Record Layer in Swift. It is **NOT production-ready**.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Critical Issues

1. **Type System Violations**
   - Uses `[String: Any]` instead of proper type-safe records
   - Violates Swift 6 Sendable constraints
   - Generic types not properly utilized

2. **Design Inconsistencies**
   - Implementation differs from Java version's Protobuf approach
   - Hardcoded field names (`_type`, `id`)
   - Missing Protobuf integration

3. **Concurrency Issues**
   - NSLock usage in async contexts (Swift 6 incompatible)
   - Incomplete thread-safety guarantees

See [IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md](IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md) for detailed analysis.

## ‚úÖ What Works

- ‚úÖ Core architecture and module structure
- ‚úÖ Subspace management
- ‚úÖ RecordMetaData and schema definition
- ‚úÖ Basic CRUD operations (with limitations)
- ‚úÖ Index maintenance (Value, Count, Sum)
- ‚úÖ Query system (basic functionality)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation

## ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

- ‚ùå Type-safe record operations
- ‚ùå Protobuf integration
- ‚ùå Swift 6 strict concurrency mode
- ‚ùå Production-grade thread safety
- ‚ùå Performance optimization

## üéØ Use Cases

### ‚úÖ Suitable For:
- Learning FoundationDB Record Layer architecture
- Understanding Swift implementation patterns
- Prototyping and experimentation
- Academic/research purposes

### ‚ùå NOT Suitable For:
- Production applications
- Type-safe record management
- High-performance requirements
- Swift 6 projects with strict concurrency

## üìã Next Steps

### Phase 2: Type Safety (Recommended)
Migrate to `Codable`-based implementation for type safety and Sendable compliance.

### Phase 3: Protobuf Integration
Full SwiftProtobuf integration for compatibility with Java version.

See [IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md](IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md) for detailed migration path.
